## Code Refactor Project

This project was primarily refactoring both the HTML and the CSS that was provided. The very first thing I looked at was accessibility. None of the images had alt tags included so that was added to all the images. Some HTML elements were replaced by semantic tags in order to make accessibility easier.

One of the links in the nav menu was brokern so an ID was added to the section the link was supposed to move the page to. There was also a lot of opportunity for consolidation within the CSS style sheet. Any elements that seemed repetitive were consolidated into one. 

Comments were also added to both the HTML and the CSS to make sure any user would be able to easily follow and identify how everything worked together. The order of some of the references in the CSS sheet were also rearranged to make sure the sheet follows the logical order followed in the HTML.

Below is a screenshot of the image provided for the project to give an example of the end result that was requested:
